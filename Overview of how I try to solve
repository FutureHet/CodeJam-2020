I did problems on my own.

I succesfully did 3 problems and in the 4 th one only passed the first test set.

1:- Iterating through the matrix and checking whether their is any duplicate or not.
2:- using one counter vairable checking whether the next no is how much more or less adn according to it increase or decrease it and adding 
    opening or closing paranthesis in the final string.
3:- Initializing the final string whith c and then cheking the next process start time and the last one index end time of both c and j and 
    according to it change the string and if getting both busy then printing impossible.
4:- In that when the bits string lenght will become more than 11 then I don't know how to manipulate it so can achive answer.
5:- I was first finding the the n elements which sum can be k and each is less than n and then .
    I first place them at the diagonal and after that using the fulfill function i filled the other elemnts by column wise from the left
    to right in matrix.
